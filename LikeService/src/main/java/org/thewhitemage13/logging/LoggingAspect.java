/**
 * Aspect for centralized logging of application methods.
 * <p>
 * This class uses Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to intercept method executions
 * and log important information such as method calls, their results, and exceptions.
 * The `LoggingAspect` ensures consistent and detailed logging across the application,
 * improving the ability to monitor and debug the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Features:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Logs method invocations with input arguments.</li>
 *     <li>Logs method execution results and durations.</li>
 *     <li>Captures and logs exceptions thrown by methods.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>How It Works:</h3>
 * <p>
 * The `LoggingAspect` uses annotations such as {@code @Before}, {@code @AfterReturning},
 * {@code @AfterThrowing}, and {@code @Around} to intercept methods in the application
 * and log details about their execution.
 * </p>
